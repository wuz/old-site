While working at HackerRank, I've built out a number of new features, working with a new team to build out a platform for conducting virtual career fairs for college computer science programs, developing a mini-ATS platform for tracking engineering job applications, and building out plans for a design system and UI component library. I worked to implement StorybookJS, Github Actions, and new component architecture in that UI component library as well as architected a GraphQL solution to integrate data from across multiple microservices into a single source of truth.

I then joined the Practice feature team, working on discovery and delivery of new features in a greenfield project. While I focused primarily on frontend development, I also spent a good amount of time working with Ruby on Rails. As a Discovery Engineer for the team, I worked closely with designers, researchers, and customers to plan and architect new features.
