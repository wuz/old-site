  <p>
    I believe in freely sharing work, especially when it has the potential to
    help folks that are still learning. All the code and content on this site is
    freely shared. Remix, reuse, copy, steal - whatever you want. I do ask that
    if you use my content, you include attributions, but you can feel free to
    make changes if you want. Just be sure to specify what parts you added and
    what parts are mine!
